__ About the game __

The Ayoayo game is similar to a traditional game played in my Country, Ghana called Oware.
This game is played on a board with two rows of six pits and a store for each player. 
Each pit starts with four seeds, making a total of 48 seeds in the game. 
The goal is to capture more seeds than the opponent by the end of the game. 
Ayoayo requires strategic thinking, quick calculations, and concentration to make the best possible moves.

__ How the Game is Played __

Each player has six pits and one store, meaning there are 12 pits and 2 stores in total. 
The game is played in a counter-clockwise direction. A player selects any of their six pits, 
picks up all the seeds from it, and distributes them one seed per pit in the rightward direction. 
If the last seed lands in a non-empty pit, the player picks up all the seeds from that pit and continues playing. 
This creates a chain reaction, leading to longer turns and requiring players to anticipate several moves ahead.

__ Winning Strategy __ 

To capture seeds, a player must place their last seed into an empty pit on their side. If this happens, the player captures:
•	All the seeds in the opponent's pit directly opposite
•	The one seed in their own pit
This makes the number of captured seeds:
(1+number of seeds in the opponent’s opposite pit) 
The collected seeds are then moved to the player’s store.
The game can end in a draw if both players collect 24 seeds each, or a player wins by accumulating at least 25 seeds.


__ Game End Conditions __ 

The game ends when one player's six pits are empty. 
At this point, the winner is the player with the most seeds stored. 
This means players must not only focus on capturing seeds but also avoid 
leaving their side empty too early, as it could lead to an immediate loss.
